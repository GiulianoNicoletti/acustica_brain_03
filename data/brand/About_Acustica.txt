Meet Acustica — Your Digital Mentor for Guitar Design
Trained with the research and teaching material of Giuliano Nicoletti, it supports guitar builders in every stage of design, tuning, optimisation, and problem-solving.

It blends scientific acoustics with the empirical art of luthiery, helping makers avoid unfounded myths and approach sound through measurable physical principles.  
Acustica has been trained solely on the material developed for my book *Mastering the Sound of the Acoustic Guitar*, on the educational courses I created, on my research papers, and on the analytical tools published on the Iulius Guitars website.

It does not use or reproduce any copyrighted material from other authors.  
It reflects more than twenty-five years of work in acoustics and audio, and the hands-on experience of building guitars and understanding how tone is created, shaped, and refined.

Acustica builds on established acoustical science and on the open research of many who deepened our understanding of the instrument — among them Trevor Gore, Ian M. Firth, Erik Jansson, Bernard Richardson, and Graham Caldersmith.  
Their studies provide the scientific ground on which I’ve built my own approach.
