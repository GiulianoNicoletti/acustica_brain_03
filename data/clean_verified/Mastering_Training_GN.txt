Mastering the Sound of the Acoustic Guitar – 2026 Training Season
A scientific approach to guitar acoustics is essential because it transforms subjective sensations into measurable data. Using measurements allows us to assign numbers to feelings, store them for future reference, and ensure accuracy and repeatability. This method can be applied from the design stage through construction steps or even at the end for fine-tuning. It is equally valuable in repair work, helping diagnose issues and verify performance.
As Massimo Vignelli wrote in The Vignelli Canon: “It’s not the intention of this little book to stifle creativity or reduce it to a bunch of rules. It’s not the formula that prevents good design from happening, but the lack of knowledge of the complexity of the designer’s job. It’s up to the brain to use the right formula to achieve the desired result.” This principle applies perfectly to guitar building: knowledge and method empower creativity.
Sound is the subjective perception of a physical phenomenon—a mechanical wave propagating through a medium as particles vibrate around their resting position. A sinusoidal wave describes this oscillation mathematically, characterized by amplitude (wave height), wavelength (distance between crests), frequency (cycles per second, in Hertz), and phase (position within the cycle). Guitar notes range from about 83 Hz (E2) to 1050 Hz (C6), within a spectrum of 20 Hz to 20 kHz that spans roughly ten octaves. Sound travels at 344 m/s in air, but its speed varies by material: rubber (60 m/s), spruce along the grain (5500 m/s), across the grain (1500 m/s), and beryllium (12,000 m/s).
Sound pressure level (SPL), perceived as loudness, is measured relative to the threshold of hearing (20 μPa) using decibels (dB SPL), a logarithmic scale suited to our wide dynamic range. For reference: conversation is about 60 dB, a stereo at 90 dB, thunder at 130 dB, and a jet takeoff at 150 dB. Doubling sound power increases SPL by 3 dB.
Sound can be analyzed in the frequency domain (frequency vs. amplitude) or time domain (amplitude vs. time). Frequency-domain visualization reveals tonal balance, while time-domain analysis shows decay and sustain. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) converts between these domains. A loudspeaker’s frequency response is smooth and linear, while a guitar’s response is full of peaks and valleys—each peak corresponding to a body resonance that amplifies certain frequencies. Measuring a guitar’s frequency response takes only five minutes, is non-destructive, and provides a clear picture of its tonal character.
Underlying these phenomena is simple harmonic motion, exemplified by a mass-spring system where energy alternates between kinetic and potential forms. The resonance frequency depends on stiffness (k) and mass (m), increasing with stiffness and decreasing with mass. Stiffness is an object’s resistance to deformation, illustrated by comparing a slinky to a car spring or a plastic ruler to a steel one. Mass, on the other hand, determines inertia and gravitational interaction. Reducing stiffness lowers resonance frequency and increases amplitude at low frequencies, which is key to achieving a powerful bass response.
Reducing the mass of the soundboard raises its resonance frequency and increases amplitude at higher frequencies. To achieve a powerful response in the mid-high range, the soundboard must remain light. Damping also plays a critical role in tonal behavior. When subjected to oscillatory forces, viscoelastic materials exhibit both elastic and viscous properties: the elastic portion, measured by the storage modulus, represents stored energy, while the viscous portion, represented by the loss modulus, corresponds to energy dissipated as heat. The ratio of these moduli defines the material’s damping capability.
Damping and the Q factor are essential for understanding oscillating systems. Damping describes how quickly energy is lost, while the Q factor measures how underdamped a system is. A high Q factor indicates low damping and sustained oscillations, whereas a low Q factor means higher damping and faster energy decay. In guitars, damping affects the amplitude at resonance frequencies and can be considered a general indicator of build quality, influenced by factors such as component coupling, nut and saddle fit, material quality, and glue type. Every detail of construction impacts the instrument’s sound and performance.
Reducing stiffness and mass increases amplitude across the entire bandwidth, often distinguishing luthier-built guitars from factory-made instruments. However, lighter structures risk long-term reliability issues such as top deformation. High mobility produces a reactive sound but increases the likelihood of wolf notes, making an active back advisable for balance.
The loudspeaker analogy helps clarify guitar acoustics: unlike a speaker cone, which moves as a single piston driven by a voice coil, a guitar soundboard exhibits standing waves. When alternating forces act on the soundboard, mechanical waves propagate through the wood at speeds determined by its density and stiffness. These waves reflect at the body’s edges, and at certain frequencies, interference between opposing waves creates standing waves with antinodes (maximum amplitude) and nodes (minimum amplitude). Some energy transfers to the sides depending on impedance mismatch.
Mechanical impedance measures a structure’s resistance to motion under force, influenced by mass and stiffness. Higher mass increases inertia, while higher stiffness resists deformation. At resonance frequencies, impedance drops, allowing the soundboard to absorb more energy and vibrate strongly, producing higher SPL. Each resonance appears as a peak in the frequency response, and about 85% of a guitar’s acoustic energy comes from its first six or seven modes. The most critical are the air mode T(1,1)₁, the soundboard monopole T(1,1)₂, and, when present, the back monopole T(1,1)₃—the monopole being the single most important.
When strings are plucked, they exert forces on the bridge and soundboard, causing vibrations that amplify the string sound by 30–40 dB, especially near body and air resonances. These forces can be divided into static and dynamic components. The static forces are constant at pitch and arise from the total string tension acting through the bridge geometry—mainly the saddle height, break angle, and pin position. They define the equilibrium load on the soundboard, producing a steady flexion and torque. The dynamic forces, generated during vibration, are responsible for driving the soundboard and radiating sound.
The transversal force acts at the fundamental frequency and provides the primary acoustic excitation, pumping and tilting the soundboard. The longitudinal force, typically smaller and oscillating at twice the fundamental frequency, contributes to the harmonic content and sustain. Their relative amplitudes depend on pluck position, amplitude, and string stiffness. The Bridge & Saddle Force Calculator on the Iulius Guitars website illustrates these relationships, showing how variations in break angle and saddle height modify both the static downforce and the dynamic excitation ratio. By analyzing these parameters, it becomes possible to visualize how the geometry of the bridge governs the conversion of string energy into soundboard motion. For medium-gauge steel strings, typical values are: longitudinal static tension ≈ 750 N per set, orthogonal static force ≈ 250 N, torsional moment ≈ 15 N·m, orthogonal dynamic forces ≈ 7.5 N per string, and longitudinal dynamic forces ≈ 1.4 N per string.
String harmonics appear as distinct peaks in the frequency spectrum, shaping tone quality through the balance of fundamentals and overtones. A plucked string initially forms a triangular shape, which can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal vibration modes, each an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency.
The nomenclature of guitar resonance modes originates from research led by Dr. Bernard Richardson at Cardiff University in the 1980s. Each mode is labeled with a letter and numbers: the first letter (usually T for Top) identifies the vibrating surface, the first number indicates the number of antinodes along the x-axis, the second number along the y-axis, and the suffix denotes the order of appearance as frequency increases.
The first resonance is the air mode, T(1,1)₁, typically between 90 and 110 Hz. This mode is always the first peak in the frequency response and is crucial for defining the guitar’s low-frequency extension and sense of body and fullness. It results from the effective mass of air in the soundhole oscillating against the stiffness of the air spring inside the box. Increasing the soundhole diameter or adding a soundport raises this frequency, while enlarging the box volume or adding a tornavoz lowers it.
This mode is often referred to as the Helmholtz resonance, but it is important to remember that the resonance frequency of the T(1,1)₁ mode is always lower than the theoretical Helmholtz frequency calculated from cavity volume and soundhole dimensions. This downward shift results from its coupling with the T(1,1)₂, the soundboard monopole mode, and, when the back is active, also with the T(1,1)₃, the back monopole. These interactions combine to push down the effective frequency of the air mode relative to the uncoupled cavity value. For a visual reference of this behavior, refer to the 4DOF simulator available on the Iulius Guitars website, which displays both coupled and uncoupled frequencies. It provides a clear view of how the strength of coupling between the top, air, and back monopoles shapes the final response curve.This mode usually corresponds to notes on the first six frets of the sixth string, and its presence can be identified by ear as adjacent notes exhibit reduced sustain and a clunky sound.
The second peak is the soundboard monopole, T(1,1)₂, generally between 170 and 220 Hz. This is the most powerful and influential resonance, defining the tonal balance and dynamic character of the guitar. It strongly couples with the air mode, so lowering T(1,1)₂ also lowers T(1,1)₁, and vice versa. The monopole determines projection, responsiveness, and susceptibility to wolf notes. Its mass and stiffness components include the bridge, central soundboard area, and part of the bracing. This mode often aligns with notes on the first frets of the fourth string and becomes evident when monopole mobility exceeds 12, though an active back can mask its presence.
The monopole’s key parameters are equivalent mass, equivalent stiffness, resonance frequency, and mobility. These govern acoustic efficiency, dynamic behavior, responsiveness under the fingers, and resistance to saturation during strong strumming. They also influence wolf-tone predisposition and stage feedback. Equivalent mass represents the portion of the soundboard actively participating in resonance; increasing it lowers frequency and reduces SPL and dynamics. Bridges typically account for 40–50% of this mass. Equivalent stiffness combines contributions from the soundboard, bracing, and bridge, and can be estimated by measuring soundboard deflection under a known load (around 1 kg) before and after gluing the bridge. Resonance frequency is the third parameter, but coupling with the air mode shifts it upward. To identify the uncoupled frequency, temporarily plug the soundhole and measure the first peak.
Monopole mobility, calculated from mass and stiffness, is inversely proportional to both. High mobility indicates a responsive instrument requiring less energy to activate the soundboard, while low mobility corresponds to rigid, heavy tops.

The back monopole, T(1,1)₃, typically occurs between 200 and 240 Hz and is activated through coupling with the soundboard monopole, T(1,1)₂, when their frequencies are close. This mode absorbs energy from the soundboard, reducing its reactivity and adding a mellow character to the tone while introducing another peak in the frequency response. Because the back lacks a bridge and concentrated mass, identifying its shape requires tapping across the entire surface and listening for active zones. The back monopole is usually higher in frequency than the soundboard monopole, though it can occasionally match or fall below it.
Phase relationships among the main modes are complex. The air mode T(1,1)₁ generally oscillates in negative phase, while the soundboard and back monopoles (T(1,1)₂ and T(1,1)₃) are in positive phase. However, phase is not constant: near resonance, the phase difference between driving force and velocity is zero, while the difference with position is 90°. Beyond resonance, the system response lags, approaching 180° as frequency rises. Absolute phase is imperceptible to the ear, but relative phase matters when multiple sources interact, as their combined output depends on amplitude and phase alignment.
Between T(1,1)₁ and T(1,1)₂, constructive interference creates a smooth valley in the frequency response, producing one of the most pleasant tonal regions—typically corresponding to the first five or six frets of the fifth string. Conversely, when the back is active, destructive interference between T(1,1)₂ and T(1,1)₃ can create a noticeable dip between their frequencies.
The first three modes are strongly coupled. The coupling of T(1,1)₁ occurs because the top plate and air cavity share the same spring—the internal air volume. When the top moves, it compresses the air, which drives the soundhole air and influences the back plate. This acoustic coupling makes their motions interdependent and shifts their natural frequencies into combined resonances. The 4-DOF model describes this behavior using four degrees of freedom: the top plate (primary sound radiator), back plate (mechanical and acoustic interaction), soundhole air (Helmholtz mode), and sides (structural stiffness and coupling path). These components capture the essential physics of low-frequency guitar behavior without the complexity of finite-element modeling.
The placement of the first triplet—T(1,1)₁, T(1,1)₂, and T(1,1)₃—defines the instrument’s tonal balance, low-frequency extension, sense of body size, and dynamic character. Beyond these, higher-order modes shape the midrange and harmonic content. At frequencies above the monopole, the soundboard divides into dipoles, tripoles, and multipoles. Their prominence depends on soundboard lightness and bracing design. Interconnected bracing patterns (lattice, double or triple X) concentrate energy on main modes, enhancing projection and dynamics while reducing higher-order resonances. Open bracing systems (fan bracing, Martin X-brace with asymmetrical tone bars) encourage higher-order modes, enriching mid-high frequencies but reducing projection.
Dipoles consist of two poles vibrating in anti-phase. If the poles are identical in size and displacement, their radiation cancels at points equidistant from both, making the mode less audible to listeners but clear to the player. Asymmetry in stiffness or mass distribution improves radiation and projection, as seen in Martin’s X-bracing or Fleta’s design. Long dipoles, excited mainly by longitudinal string forces rocking the saddle, are crucial in classical guitars, which have lower stiffness and better bridge placement. Cross-dipoles respond to transverse forces and single-string action, rolling the saddle. These dipoles typically occur between 250 and 450 Hz. In Martin-style guitars with double tone bars, they often merge into a single SPL peak that defines the instrument’s characteristic sound. In classical guitars, both dipoles are closer to the monopole frequency and play a significant role in tonal color.
The tripoles, T(3,1) and T(1,3), are usually the last clearly defined resonance peaks in the guitar’s frequency response. They can act as powerful radiators, contributing to the brilliance and sparkle of higher notes on the fretboard. These modes typically occur between 450 and 1000 Hz and correspond to the upper frets of the first string. At even higher frequencies, additional multipole resonances appear, producing distinct peaks in the response curve depending on the lightness of the soundboard and bridge. While these modes are always present, they may not generate sufficient acoustic pressure to be clearly visible in the curve. Their distribution across the soundboard is difficult to predict because bracing design has less influence at these frequencies, and small material or assembly variations can significantly affect their behavior.
The principle of conservation of momentum governs all these resonances. In a multipole mode, opposite poles must oscillate so that their momenta are equal and opposite (m₁v₁ = –m₂v₂), ensuring momentum conservation. For the soundboard monopole, the second pole is effectively the rest of the guitar body, which moves very little due to its much greater mass. This explains why changes in the sides’ mass or stiffness directly affect monopole parameters. Similarly, for dipoles and tripoles, altering a single antinode can shift both amplitude and resonance frequency.
When strings force the soundboard to vibrate, they activate multiple modes simultaneously. The amplitude of each mode depends on geometry—whether the string’s attachment point lies on a node or antinode—and frequency proximity to the mode’s resonance. The instrument’s response is the sum of all these modes acting together. Above 1.5 kHz, the guitar body contributes less SPL than the strings, which dominate the sound at very high frequencies. At these ranges, details such as coupling between parts, glue quality, and material properties influence the Q factor of string resonances, shaping the clarity and sustain of the instrument’s upper register.
To evaluate the performance of an acoustic guitar, two primary measurements are essential: the frequency response and the monopole parameters. The frequency response reveals tonal balance, low-frequency extension, midrange presence, back activity, and susceptibility to wolf notes. Monopole parameters, on the other hand, define the dynamic character, responsiveness, reactivity, and long-term structural reliability of the instrument. Additionally, Chladni patterns can be used to assess bracing design and radiation characteristics.
There is no universal standard for measuring frequency response, but the hammer-and-microphone technique is widely recommended for its simplicity, versatility, and reliability. This method requires a UMIK-1 microphone, REW software, and a laptop. Measurements are taken in the near field, with the microphone positioned 2–5 cm from the vibrating surface, making room acoustics largely irrelevant. The type of hammer used significantly affects the excitation spectrum bandwidth; a piano hammer is ideal because it provides a broad bandwidth and is safe for soundboards.
Instrument holding also influences results. The guitar can be held by the neck in a standing position or placed on a chair, though variations occur depending on back activity and neck stiffness. Special attention should be paid to the first bar mode, which has a node just below the nut and an antinode at the neck joint.
Microphone positioning and tap points are critical. Symmetric dipoles radiate zero energy on-axis, so the microphone should be placed slightly off both vertical and lateral axes to capture dipoles and tripoles effectively. Tapping on a node does not excite a mode, while tapping at the center of an antinode applies maximum energy. For standard frequency response measurements, position the microphone off-axis between the bridge and soundhole and tap around the saddle, bridge, and slightly lower on the soundboard. For local investigations, tap and measure close to the area of interest at 2–5 cm from the surface.
Excitation and recording require averaging techniques in REW software. For standard measurements, use 32 averages with one hit every two seconds. For local investigations, use four averages for faster feedback, which highlights differences between soundboard zones and modes. The first stage of analysis involves identifying the main resonance frequencies and checking for higher modes, including dipoles, tripoles, the air mode, and monopoles.
Tapping specific modes in the near field provides a quick confirmation of their nature and location on the soundboard. For frequency response measurements, use 32 averages at about 25 cm from the surface. For tapping modes, use 4 averages in the near field or the most convenient averaging setting. Tap close to the microphone, at the center of the antinode of the mode being investigated. For example, a tap confirmation of the cross-dipole in an OM-type acoustic guitar can be visualized on the curve.
To check for wolf tones, play the strings—ensuring perfect tuning—while observing the frequency response curve. This reveals how notes interact with specific modes, allowing both visual and acoustic verification. The analysis can cover the entire soundboard and frequency spectrum, including fundamental notes and harmonics. Measure the frequency response with 32 averages at about 25 cm, and record played notes with 4 averages to examine frequency, peak shape (look for split peaks at wolf notes), and sustain.
For tonal balance, play a sequence of chords over a stored frequency response curve. This provides a clear visualization of the guitar’s tonal balance. Measure the frequency response with 32 averages at about 25 cm, then record a second curve with 32 averages at RTA 1/6 octave while playing the seven major and minor chords in sequence. For example, the RTA curve of an OM-type acoustic guitar can show these chords played in order.
Finally, measuring monopole parameters involves two steps: first, measure the deflection at the center of the soundboard under an applied weight; second, measure the resonance frequency of the monopole uncoupled from other box modes by closing the soundhole. Parameter calculation is performed using the dedicated Excel spreadsheet.
To measure monopole parameters, apply the weight at the center of the soundboard using a dedicated jig. The measurement process then moves to the visualization of Chladni patterns, which requires a sinusoidal generator (such as a smartphone app), a Bluetooth digital amplifier, and a full-range speaker. It is essential to keep the guitar soundboard in a horizontal position to allow the leaves to move freely.
The recommended equipment includes a Faital 4FE32 full-range speaker mounted in a one-liter box with a recessed baffle, a smartphone with a frequency generator app, and a Nobsound Mini 50W Bluetooth digital amplifier. For the setup, place the amplifier nearby for easy volume adjustment, position the guitar flat on three blocks to avoid damping the back, and keep the speaker about two centimeters from the soundboard, ideally with a handle added to the box. Then sweep through frequencies using the app.
If you need to locate a specific mode, start by setting the generator to the frequency of the peak you want to investigate. Move the speaker around the active area of the soundboard, typically the lower bout, and look for the position that makes the surface vibrate most strongly. Gradually refine the shape of the mode—for example, identifying a cross-dipole at around 380 Hz.
If you need to find a frequency rather than a mode, note that placing the speaker in certain positions may fail to excite the mode. In such cases, tapping at the correct point can excite the mode and reveal its peak on the curve. Sweep the generator around the possible frequencies while moving the speaker across the active area of the soundboard to confirm the resonance.
The main tonewood parameters are density, stiffness, radiation coefficient, and damping. Density is the mass of an object divided by its volume. Stiffness refers to the resistance to deformation under an external force and is commonly expressed as Young’s modulus (E). The radiation coefficient indicates how much energy is needed to excite the plate into vibration; it is proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to the cube of density, as described by J.C. Schelleng in 1963. Damping represents a material’s ability to dissipate energy during mechanical vibrations. These parameters exhibit significant variability, making direct measurement essential.
Generally, higher density correlates with higher stiffness, but whether this relationship compensates for final thickness and mass must be evaluated. Tonewoods also exhibit orthotropic properties: for example, spruce has a long-grain stiffness roughly ten times greater than its cross-grain stiffness. Orthotropic behavior shifts the frequencies of eigenmodes in plates with fixed constraints, although the mode shapes remain unchanged compared to isotropic materials.
Damping is another critical factor. Low damping corresponds to a high quality factor (Q), with typical values ranging from Q = 100  to Q = 200. Measuring density is straightforward, but stiffness and damping require more advanced techniques. Stiffness can be assessed through static testing, which applies a constant load, or dynamic testing, which applies varying loads over time to simulate vibrations. Dynamic methods are often preferred for acoustic applications.
Stiffness measurement techniques include analyzing twisting modes, long-grain modes, and cross-grain modes, as described by Caldersmith (1991) and Hearmon (1946), and further developed by Gilet and Gore (2011). Damping measurement can be performed using a Lucchimeter, which operates at high frequencies but is expensive and measures the damping of the resonant system rather than the material itself. More accurate and reproducible methods rely on FFT analysis, such as the half-power method or the logarithmic decrement method. The half-power method is simple but requires careful sample handling and correct FFT settings, while the logarithmic decrement method is the most precise and requires specialized software like TPC (Tonewood Parameter Characterization). TPC enables damping measurements without expensive hardware.
In summary, designing an acoustic guitar involves balancing structural and acoustic properties. The key tonewood parameters—density, stiffness, damping, and radiation coefficient—show wide variability, so consistent measurement is essential. Modern systems now allow reliable and comprehensive characterization of tonewoods, ensuring better control over instrument performance.
The design of an acoustic guitar involves balancing two aspects: the structural integrity of the guitar body and the acoustic performance of its vibrating surfaces. The strings exert a continuous load on the structure, causing flexion of the soundboard. For steel-string guitars, this force is about 720 N, while for classical guitars with nylon strings it is around 450 N. The torque applied at the nut is approximately 10 N·m for an acoustic guitar (14 mm nut height) and 5 N·m for a classical guitar (11 mm nut height). At the bridge, this load is resolved into a combination of vertical force and rotational moment that determine the static equilibrium of the top. The vertical component acts downward on the saddle, while the opposing reaction at the pin or anchor point acts upward. Because these two forces are separated by the pin-to-saddle distance, they create a static bridge torque (or rocking moment) that tends to rotate the bridge and bend the soundboard locally. The magnitude of this torque depends on the saddle height, break angle, and total string tension. The vertical component, governed by the break angle, is fundamental because it keeps the string seated on the saddle and ensures effective coupling and transmission of vibration to the soundboard, even during strong plucking. For this reason, a static force can influence the guitar’s acoustic behavior indirectly, by maintaining contact and mechanical continuity between the vibrating string and the bridge. Monitoring this component—through the calculator available on the website—helps evaluate the balance between downforce, torque, and the structural response of the top.
The bracing system is essential to withstand this load without adding excessive mass to the soundboard. These calculations are integrated into the specific tool on Iulius Guitars website, which considers the moment of inertia—a measure of a shape’s resistance to bending—and flexural rigidity (EI), which combines material stiffness (Young’s modulus) and structural geometry. Average EI values for classical and steel-string guitars are typically calculated for a section of the soundboard located 50 mm in front of the bridge. Brace design plays a critical role: three braces of equal mass but different dimensions (12×3 mm, 6×6 mm, 3×12 mm) can produce EI values ranging from 0.3 to 4.3 N·m². Mass is proportional to thickness, while stiffness is proportional to the cube of thickness, meaning doubling thickness increases stiffness eightfold.
A practical indicator of flexural rigidity is the rotation of the bridge under string tension. Instruments with less than one degree of rotation exhibit high bending stiffness, while those exceeding two degrees are very light and may suffer long-term deformation, especially if bracing uses only wood without composites. Optimized bracing is typically high and thin, and EI should be adapted to the instrument’s type and function.
Acoustic design begins with analyzing the frequency response, which is the primary indicator of timbre. The positioning of the first two or three modes largely defines the instrument’s tonal character. Lower frequencies produce a warmer, fuller sound, while higher frequencies yield a brighter, more dynamic tone. These values depend on balancing mass and stiffness. The Tone Profiler tool helps define targets for monopole parameters, soundboard design, acoustic power, tonal balance, low-frequency extension, midrange presence, back activity, and wolf-tone susceptibility. Mode shapes, bracing design, soundboard coupling with sides, and radiation characteristics also influence the final sound.
The first three coupled modes determine much of the instrument’s acoustic balance. Adjustments to soundhole dimensions and back resonance frequency can fine-tune the curve. Lowering the first mode’s frequency reduces its amplitude, favoring fingerpicking guitars, while raising it increases power and attack, preferred for bluegrass or blues. Higher-order modes affect midrange response and depend on soundboard mass and bracing design.
Monopole mobility is another key parameter. Greater mobility increases sensitivity but can lead to more wolf tones, while lower mobility reduces feedback and suits live strumming. Mobility can result from different combinations of mass and stiffness, producing distinct tonal qualities: light tops offer attack and dynamics, while heavier tops provide warmth and smoothness. Balancing soundboard and bracing is crucial. Most mass resides in the soundboard, while stiffness is concentrated in the bracing. Minimum acceptable board thickness is about 1.5 mm, and braces should be at least 3 mm wide. Braces with less than 15° inclination risk leaving marks on the soundboard, so the structure must support the surface evenly. The Guitar Design Tools Excel file allows comparison of different stiffness distributions.
Spruce remains the most suitable brace material due to its lightness, rigidity, and high modulus of failure, though composite materials like Gore’s falcate carbon sandwich can deliver excellent results. Throughout the design process, key parameters—target frequencies, mobility, and bridge rotation—must be monitored, as they are interdependent. Measuring bridge rotation is quick and provides a simple indication of the soundboard’s EI, it should be comprised between 1° and 2°.
Determining the correct thickness for the soundboard and bracing is one of the most debated topics in guitar design. There are many approaches: following original instrument plans, empirical considerations of stiffness and mass, experience and trial-and-error, decisions based on wood properties, and scientific methods. Our goal was to compare these methods reliably, accounting for the variability of wood.
The traditional method reproduces the exact geometry of an original instrument, without requiring information about wood properties. Another approach is based on vibrational stiffness, which requires four measurements of wood stiffness along different directions (EL, ER, GLR). This method is complex and prone to error, but it relies on established research by Hearmon (1946), Caldersmith (1991), and Gore (2013). 
A simpler concept is the target mass method: since wood density varies, using the same thickness results in soundboards with different masses. By tuning thickness to achieve a consistent target mass, we can standardize performance. The simplified beam method adapts soundboard thickness to target mass and adjusts bracing height to achieve a stiffness target. Brace tuning goes further: the board provides mass and radiating surface, while bracing is carved from an overbuilt pattern to reach a target monopole frequency. Free plate tuning, which aims to match the frequency of a free plate mode, proves ineffective because the correlation between fan-bracing stiffness and free-edge bending modes is weak.
The target mass approach stands out for its simplicity and reliability. Just thickness the soundboard to achieve a specific target mass. Adding a way to fine-tune bracing height for stiffness or monopole frequency brings the best results with minimal added complexity.
The bracing system does not significantly alter the shape of the monopole, which remains centered around the bridge. However, moving the bridge—such as choosing between a 14-fret or 12-fret design—shifts the monopole’s position on the soundboard and changes its resonant frequency due to variations in surface area and equivalent mass. Areas outside the nodal line vibrate in anti-phase to the monopole, reducing acoustic emission.
Asymmetrical bracing systems, such as the Fleta design, push the nodal line of the lateral dipole away from the bridge’s center. This places a larger portion of the dipole under the bridge’s positive phase influence, increasing sound pressure in the mid-high range—a desirable feature for nylon-string guitars. Using an LED lamp inside the body helps visualize the braces alongside Chladni patterns.
Interconnected bracing systems, like lattice or triple-X designs, concentrate most acoustic energy on the monopole, producing strong projection and fewer surface markings from the bars. Conversely, open-type bracing, such as Martin’s X-brace or traditional fan bracing, enhances higher-order modes, creating a less powerful sound but richer midrange. Small changes in these schemes have minimal effect because upper mode shapes are primarily determined by soundboard size. Asymmetrical bracing also improves acoustic output and reduces sensitivity to listening position and room acoustics, unlike symmetrical bracing, which often introduces a null along the central axis.
The back of the guitar plays a critical role in tonal behavior. An active back absorbs energy from the soundboard, reducing wolf-tone sensitivity and adding harmonic richness through an additional resonance. However, excessive back mobility can reduce the dynamic and punch of the guitar. Since the back lacks a bridge, it is lighter than the top. Designing an active back requires bracing that defines the main resonance zone, maximizing activation energy and controlling monopole frequency. Visualizing Chladni patterns helps identify active areas and compare them to the frequency response curve. Back resonances above twice the soundboard’s monopole frequency are usually weak or absent.
The sides influence mechanical impedance at the soundboard’s edge and its coupling with the structure. Key parameters are mass and stiffness. Structured sides provide stability and decoupling, while added mass can adjust coupling and monopole frequency. A more coupled soundboard (lighter sides) yields a percussive tone with less sustain (as in flamenco guitars), whereas a more decoupled soundboard (heavier sides) offers greater harmonic content and sustain. Side stiffness also affects damping of the main acoustic resonance T(1,1)₁.
The bridge and bridge plate are central to defining the monopole’s equivalent mass, often accounting for 50% or more of the soundboard’s weight. Their design influences tonal balance: a heavier bridge reduces high-frequency bandwidth, smooths tone, lowers sensitivity, and increases sustain and intonation stability, reducing wolf notes. However, higher equivalent mass decreases acoustic output from the box, emphasizing string-produced high frequencies. Bridge and plate also determine cross-stiffness and control resonance frequencies of cross dipoles and tripoles.
The box volume represents the elastic component of the first resonance and affects its frequency and acoustic power. A 20% change in volume significantly alters coupling with monopoles. The soundhole defines the mass component of the first acoustic resonance. In Martin guitars, a 3 mm diameter change shifts frequency by about 2 Hz. Moving the soundhole toward the edges lengthens its virtual neck, lowering resonance frequency. Adding a tornavoz increases acoustic mass and lowers both frequency and SPL, while additional apertures (soundports) enlarge the opening and raise resonance frequency.
Finally, the coupling of the main modes can be evaluated using a lumped-parameter model with four degrees of freedom (4-DOF), as described by Trevor Gore. This approach simplifies the vibrating guitar body into four interacting components: the top monopole, the back monopole, the soundhole air mode, and the sides. The simulator of 4DOF on Iulius Guitar website is very flexible, powerful, and free.

Designing the soundboard involves several possible approaches: the traditional method, vibrational stiffness, brace tuning, and the TPC system. Construction progresses through stages such as closing the box, tuning braces and soundports, applying the finish, installing the bridge, adjusting the active back, and finally stringing the instrument. At each stage, tuning can be refined using added masses, soundhole adjustments, or selective interventions guided by Chladni pattern visualization. These techniques allow control over mode frequencies, wolf notes, and the overall tonal character of the strings.
The TPC system (Tonewood Parameter Characterization) adds damping and sustain analysis to tonewood selection, providing valuable data for material evaluation. 
Radiation coefficient, defined by J.C. Schelleng in 1963, measures the energy required to excite the plate into vibration and is proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to the cube of density (E/ρ³). A high radiation coefficient is desirable for instruments with strong acoustic projection, while a lower coefficient suits guitars intended for amplified performance. Vibrational stiffness methods rely on measuring tonewood parameters and building the soundboard to a thickness target, using established research by Hearmon (1946), Caldersmith (1991), and Gore (2013). Brace tuning combines a mass target for the soundboard with carving braces to achieve desired frequencies. Brace tuning is possibly the most simple and effective method. Central longitudinal braces control monopole stiffness, while cross braces influence cross-grain modes such as dipoles and tripoles. Carving braces before gluing is inconsistent and not recommended.

Once the box is closed, the first three resonance modes become evident, and selective adjustments can be made through the soundhole using a mini-plane, scalloping the height of braces, reducing their stiffness and the resonance frequency. Even sanding of the soundboard lowers all mode frequencies, while targeted interventions—such as adding 5 grams of putty at specific points—modify individual modes without affecting others. Soundhole size can also be adjusted at this stage; for example, a 3 mm diameter change shifts frequency by about 2 Hz in an OM-style guitar.
The finishing process, the lacquer, adds mass and damping, lowering both resonance frequencies and amplitudes. Measuring before and after finishing reveals these changes. Gluing the bridge introduces additional mass and cross-stiffness, lowering the monopole frequency and raising cross-dipole frequencies. Split peaks in the monopole often result from coupling with the back and may disappear during final tuning. When uncertain, perform an uncoupled frequency response measurement.
The active back requires careful tuning. Near-field measurements help identify its resonance frequency, which is easier to lower than to raise. Modifying the back also affects the soundboard and the first acoustic resonance. For passive backs, near-field analysis with direct stimulation of the back monopole is essential. Added masses on the sides provide a final tuning option, lowering the monopole frequency without altering other modes. Typically, the monopole should be left a few hertz higher before adding mass. Small modifications—such as replacing plastic saddles and pins with bone or installing pickups—also influence resonance frequencies and should be considered in the final tuning phase.
In summary, several techniques exist for soundboard design, but the simplest and most effective method is targeting the soundboard mass and adjusting brace height to achieve desired frequencies. Evaluating tonewood damping adds valuable insight into material performance. Free soundboard tuning offers limited results, while systematic checks during construction prevent issues that are difficult to correct later. To modify a mode’s frequency or amplitude, identify its mass and elastic components and avoid disturbing others. Lowering frequencies is straightforward; raising them is much harder. Chladni pattern visualization enables selective interventions by highlighting active areas at specific frequencies.
