main resonance modes of acoustic guitar,clean_verified/Mastering_Training_GN.txt,45.9,"The first resonance is the air mode, T(1,1)₁, typically between 90 and 110 Hz. This mode is always the first peak in the frequency response and is crucial for defining the guitar’s low-frequency extension and sense of body and fullness. It results from the effective mass of air in the soundhole oscillating against the stiffness of the air spring inside the box. Increasing the soundhole diameter or adding a soundport raises this frequency, while enlarging the box volume or adding a tornavoz lower"

air cavity Helmholtz mode formula,clean_verified/Mastering_Training_GN.txt,-6.8,"The first three modes are strongly coupled. The coupling of T(1,1)₁ occurs because the top plate and air cavity share the same spring—the internal air volume. When the top moves, it compresses the air, which drives the soundhole air and influences the back plate. This acoustic coupling makes their motions interdependent and shifts their natural frequencies into combined resonances. The 4-DOF model describes this behavior using four degrees of freedom: the top plate (primary sound radiator), back"

Resonance placement and amplitude strongly influence tonal character. Forces on the bridge include longitudinal tension changes, tilting forces, and transverse pumping motions.

effect of bridge pin height on break angle,clean_verified/Mastering_Training_GN.txt,2.4,"distance, they create a static bridge torque (or rocking moment) that tends to rotate the bridge and bend the soundboard locally. The magnitude of this torque depends on the saddle height, break angle, and total string tension. The vertical component, governed by the break angle, is fundamental because it keeps the string seated on the saddle and ensures effective coupling and transmission of vibration to the soundboard, even during strong plucking. For this reason, a static force can influence "

This acoustic coupling makes their motions interdependent and shifts their natural frequencies into combined resonances. The 4-DOF model describes this behavior using four degrees of freedom: the top plate (primary sound radiator), back"

air–top coupling in low frequency range,clean_verified/Mastering_Training_GN.txt,-7.4,"This mode is often referred to as the Helmholtz resonance, but it is important to remember that the resonance frequency of the T(1,1)₁ mode is always lower than the theoretical Helmholtz frequency calculated from cavity volume and soundhole dimensions. This downward shift results from its coupling with the T(1,1)₂, the soundboard monopole mode, and, when the back is active, also with the T(1,1)₃, the back monopole. These interactions combine to push down the effective frequency of the air mode r"
